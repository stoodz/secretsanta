# secretsanta

Secret Santa is a small Laravel 5.1 app that allows an organizer to create a Secret Santa List. The organizer receives an email, and distributes the link to all guest participants. The guests enter their name and email, therby opting-in. Once all optin-ins are done, the orgnizer can generate the list. 

A very simple algorithm chooses the next person in the list as their Secret Santa recipient, and emails the name.

# Motivation

This was written so that my family could participate in a list even though they were spread across the country. They were all planning to be together, but couldn't be toegether for the secret santa list process.
